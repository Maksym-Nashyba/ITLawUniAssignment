    <h1>Accessibility Statement</h1>

    <p>
      Pointless Polygon Studio is committed to making this website accessible in
      accordance with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.2,
      Level AA.
    </p>

    <h2>Conformance Status</h2>

    <p>
      This website is designed to be largely compliant with WCAG 2.2 Level AA.
      Accessibility was considered during design and implementation, with a
      focus on semantic HTML, readability, and keyboard usability.
    </p>

    <h2>Accessibility Features</h2>

    <ul>
      <li>Semantic HTML structure using headings, landmarks, and lists</li>
      <li>Text alternatives (alt attributes) for all meaningful images</li>
      <li>Sufficient color contrast between text and background</li>
      <li>Keyboard-accessible navigation and controls</li>
      <li>Responsive layout that supports zooming and different screen sizes</li>
      <li>No autoplaying audio or video</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Known Limitations</h2>

    <p>
      Despite best efforts, some limitations may exist:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        Embedded third-party content (e.g. YouTube links) may not fully meet
        accessibility requirements, as they are controlled by external providers.
      </li>
      <li>
        The website has not undergone formal external accessibility certification
        or a full VPAT audit.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      Accessibility was evaluated using:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Manual testing with keyboard navigation</li>
      <li>WAVE - the automated tool</li>
      <li>Visual inspection for contrast and readability</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Feedback and Contact</h2>

    <p>
