    <h1>About Us</h1>

    <p>
      <strong>Pointless Polygons</strong> is a small independent game studio
      focused on experimental and intentionally minimal game concepts.
      The studio was created as part of a university project and does not
      currently operate as a commercial entity.
    </p>

    <h2>Our Brands</h2>

    <p>
      As part of this project, a distinct trademark form was designed.
    </p>

    <h3>1. Word Mark: “An Unremarkable Bike Game”</h3>

    <p>
      This word mark represents the title of the game itself. The intentionally
      descriptive and self-deprecating wording was chosen to avoid confusion
      with existing commercial titles and to clearly communicate the tone of
      the game.
    </p>

    <p>
      The wording does not reference any existing brands, franchises, or
      protected titles and is therefore unlikely to cause confusion in the
      marketplace.
    </p>

    <p>
      <strong>Relevant Nice Class:</strong><br />
      Class 9 – Computer software and video game software
    </p>

    <h2>Trademark Law Considerations</h2>

    <p>
      Care was taken to avoid trademark infringement by ensuring:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Original wording without references to existing brands</li>
      <li>Abstract and non-descriptive imagery</li>
      <li>Neutral color choices without strong brand associations</li>
      <li>Clear separation from existing commercial offerings</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      No trademark registrations currently exist for this project. All brands
      are used solely within the context of this academic exercise.
